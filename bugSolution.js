The problem was resolved by using `onDisconnect()` to ensure data is written correctly even if the client disconnects.  Additionally, instead of using `set()`, the solution utilized `update()` to avoid overwriting data unnecessarily, which could create race conditions and prevent the update from being properly applied.  The corrected code uses appropriate event listeners to handle changes properly, ensuring real-time updates. The `on()` method is used with `.once()` to ensure the data is retrieved only once.  The code also includes a check to handle potential null values.
