In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating in real-time using Firebase's Realtime Database.  My client-side code showed successful writes using `set()` or `update()`, but the changes weren't reflected in other connected clients or the database console. The relevant code snippets are below.  I've double-checked my security rules to ensure they allow the write operation.
